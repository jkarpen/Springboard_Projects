This repository contains data, code, and reports generated for my Capstone Project as part of Springboard's Data Science with Python Intensive Program. The Final Report describing the project is in the reports folder. A high level description of the project is available as a blog post here: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/predicting-airbnb-listing-price-utilization-joshua-karpen/

Data Visualizations: Images created in Exploratory Data Analysis. Code in Data Storytelling script. 

Data: 
1. data_files.zip: zipped AirBnB listings and Yelp datasets, raw.
2. listings_clean.csv: AirBnB listings data for Toronto, downloaded from InsideAirBnB.com and passed through initial data wrangling steps.
3. yelp_clean.csv: Yelps' Academic dataset, passed through initial data wrangling steps. 
4. abb_merged.csv: AirBnB dataset merged with Yelp data metrics (code in Data Merge script). 
5. abb_stat_inf_changes.csv: abb_merged dataset, with some additional transformations. Refer to statistical inference script for code. 

Reports: Reports submitted as part of Capstone project at various stages
1. Project Proposal
2. Data Wrangling
3. Data Storytelling
4. Statistical Inference
5. Final Report
6. Presentation Slides (Powerpoint slides used to present the project)

Scripts: Python Notebooks with code for all steps
1. Capstone_DataWrangling_Script - Initial data cleanup/transformations.
2. Capstone_Data_Merge_Script - Code to merge AirBnB and Yelp data. Has neighborhood cleanup steps, and a distance function to find the distance between each AirBnB listing and each Yelp business. 
3. Capstone_Data_Sotry_Script - Data visualizations created as part of Exploratory Data Analysis. 
4. Capstone_Statistical_Inference - Statistical tests performed as part of Exploratory Data Analysis.
5. Capstone_Modeling_Script - Modeling steps.
