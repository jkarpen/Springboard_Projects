    " -  bathrooms, bedrooms, beds: these all have significant differences between the 90th percentile and the max. I will trim these to the 99th percentile.\n",
    " -  price: I see potential outliers at both ends of the spectrum. There is obviously at least one extreme outlier on the high end of price at \\$13,010, where the 90th percentile is 250. I will inspect all records higher than the 90th percentile and decide whether I should trim them to the 90th or 99th percentiles, or remove those records entirely. I also plan to inspect records with $0 price as this seems inaccurate. These will likely be removed from the dataset. \n",
    " -  security_deposit, cleaning fee: similar to price these seem influenced by outliers at the high and low ends. I will inspect these further. It also might be worthwhile to combine price, security_deposit, and cleaning_fee into one \"total_price\" variable.\n",
    " -  guests_included, extra_people: contain outliers at the high end. I will likely trim these to the 90th or 99th percentile, but the outliers might also be removed if I get rid of the price outlier record(s). \n",
    " -  minimum_nights, maximum_nights: these also appear to have outliers at the high end. I will likely trim them to the 99th percentile. I am also not sure if maximum_nights has much value to my analysis as even the median is in the thousands. I will inspect it further.\n",
    " -  reviews_per_month: I am keeping this merely to help estimate the true availability of a listing, after which it will be dropped and not used for modeling. So while it appears to have outliers I will not modify this variable."
